Contributions Week 1:
---------------------
Over the past week, I wrote all the html pages for the project, and wrote boilerplate
CGI scripts and accompanying java scripts for every page except for the sign up page. 
Instead of making the CGI/Java scripts generate HTML, I put all the HTML in the
HTML files and had the CJI/Java scripts return JSON documents, that I requested
using an API call from the Javascript in the website. As of 8:20 on November 24, 2020,
everything in graupe_Front_End_2 was written by me.

Contributions Week 2:
---------------------
This week, I wrote the html document for  the CreateTicket page and finished writing
the rest of cji and java files for the API that the front end website uses to access
the back end. Now, all I have to do is document the code and start bringing in the
back end and data wrangling.

Contributions Week 3:
---------------------
<Replace this with a list your contributions for the week 3 deliverable.
You can list the java files that you wrote and committed during the first week,
or the data files your created or worked on. If you haven't written any code or
other content that your can commit, provide a list of the work that you did
during week 3. Make sure that all your week 3 contributions and this section
of the readme are committed and pushed to the GitHub repo by the week 3 deadline
on 12/08 at 11:59pm CST.>

Files written by me:
--------------------
<List ALL of the source files here that were written by you. Note that each of the
files must contain correct file headers, including your name, team, and role. List
files one per line in this section of the README. Only complete this section with
your final week 3 submission of project four.>

Files submitted with this project that were developed in an earlier project:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<If you have any files written by you or your team in your submission that were
written for an earlier project and that you re-used for project four, replace this
text with a list of these files. Provide file name and path as well as the project
that they were originally developed for.>

Web address at which the program is available:
----------------------------------------------
https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~elan/project-four-bg/graupe_Front_End_2/SignIn.html
(The home page of this website is a sign-in page. Since the sign-up as not yet been
implemented and the backend is not yet ready to handle customer accounts, you can sign
as an customer using 'customer' as your username and any password that has at least 1
character, or sign in as an admin using 'admin' as your username and any password that
has at least one character. I am having the CGI/Java program return sample tickets and
and user information if one of these accounts is used.)

Additional notes about the submission:
--------------------------------------
<List any additional notes for the grader here (only required by the final deadline).>
